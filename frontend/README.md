# CreditPathAI – Frontend Module

## Overview
This frontend module is designed to visualize borrower risk and recovery
recommendations generated by the CreditPathAI system.

The frontend is implemented using React.js and Plotly.js and follows a
component-based architecture.

---

## Components Description

### 1. RiskDashboard.js
- Displays borrower risk distribution (Low / Medium / High)
- Uses Plotly.js charts for visualization
- Helps stakeholders understand portfolio-level risk

### 2. RecommendationTable.js
- Displays borrower-wise recommendations
- Columns include:
  - Customer ID
  - Risk Band
  - Recommended Action
- Intended for loan recovery agents

---

## API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend through an API service layer:

- File: `services/api.js`
- Backend: FastAPI (prototype)
- Endpoint: `/predict`

This design ensures separation of frontend and backend logic.

---

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Risk distribution chart displays correct categories
- Agent recommendations align with business logic
- Test inputs return consistent outputs

---

## Future Enhancements
- Live API integration
- Authentication for agents
- Role-based dashboards

---

## Status
Frontend prototype created for academic and evaluation purposes.
